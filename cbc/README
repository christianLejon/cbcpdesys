CBC.PDESys
---------

CBC.PDESys is a Python package, built on top of FEniCS, for specifying and
solving large systems of nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with
very compact, flexible and reusable code (see, e.g.,
http://fenicsproject.org/featured/2011/pdesys.html). The package is completely
general and targets any system of PDEs. CBC.PDESys is primarily being developed 
at the Center for Biomedical Computing at Simula Research Laboratory in Oslo, 
Norway. CBC.PDESys is distributed freely in the hope that it will be useful, but 
without any warranty. 

More information about the FEniCS Project can be found at the address
